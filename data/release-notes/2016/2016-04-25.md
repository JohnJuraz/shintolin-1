* Settlements may once again build a `Hunter's Shrine`! Members of the settlement may then sacrifice certain goods (`mammoth tusks` only for now) to gain `Favor` for their settlement. This favor is shown on a new `Favored Settlements` leaderboard. There will be more uses for `Favor` in the future â€“ stay tuned...
* You may now use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting in your character or settlement's profile.
* BUG FIX: Inactive+Dazed players no longer count toward maximum occupancy (as they don't show up on the map and thus cannot be kicked out). Hat tip to @Juraz.
* BUG FIX: Maximum Occupancy wasn't actually being taken into account during the AP recovery calculation yet! Whoops!
