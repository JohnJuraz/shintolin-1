* When encumbered you may now still move, but at double the standard AP cost.
* Significantly increased both the health of all buildings and the amount of health recovered when repairing a building. This effect scales up with building complexity – more "modern" buildings received a much larger buff than the simplest huts. Totems received the largest buff.
* Totems can now be targeted without destroying other buildings in the settlement first – keep them repaired!
* Buildings withing the boundaries of a settlement are now protected by settlement members standing on that tile. Attackers cannot attack a building where non-provisional, non-dazed members of the settlement are standing (outside) on the same tile as the targeted building. In other words: guard duty time!
