* Migrated our database to the latest version of the server software, which should provide a big performance boost. Unfortunately it is also likely to have caused a few bugs that I have yet to catch. Keep me informed in Slack, please.
* Shintolin is now an island!
* You now take periodic damage if you remain in water for too long. Learning the _swimming_ skill will prevent you from taking this damage in shallow water, but nobody can swim in deep water for long.
* You no longer see inactive dazed players on the map!
* Fixed bug that prevented players from kicking dazed players out of a building's interior.
* Fixed bug that prevented certain settlements from being destroyed (if a Ruins or Cave was found nearby.)
* Fixed bug that was preventing elections from proceeding as expected.
* Fixed bug that allowed dazed players to revive themselves at any settlement building. It must now be from within a hospital.
* Properly displaying destroyed settlements as destroyed in the leaderboards. Removed destroyed settlements from the list of most populated settlements.
