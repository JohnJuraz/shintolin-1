* Longhouses can now be converted into **workshops**, which allow certain items to be crafted for a lower AP cost, or **hospitals**, where healing items are more effective. However, doing this removes the AP restoration benefits of the longhouse.
* Players now cook the pieces of **raw meat** in their inventory all at once, rather than one by one. The AP cost is fixed, regardless of how much meat is cooked.
