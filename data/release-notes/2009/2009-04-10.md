* **Images** can now be included on player profiles. Actions such as **adding fuel** to campfires and **chopping down trees** are now recorded.
* Multiple heights of **hills** were added, and AP costs for climbing hills were changed to be more logical (it costs more AP to climb a hill, than to move around once up there). **Impassable** terrain types were added.
