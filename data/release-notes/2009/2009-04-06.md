* Shintolin astronomers are reporting that the pace of life has changed; the **years** now pass a rate of one every twelve real life days.
* **Inactive players** now dissapear from the map after 5 days. Their accounts are not deleted and their characters reappear when they log back in.
* In response to player feedback, players' actions are less limited when **dazed**; they can now search, give items, trade, and use non-revive items. To balance this, they now regain AP at a much slower rate until they are revived.
* **New players** begin the game with three days' worth of food - however, they can only eat it while they remain at level one.
