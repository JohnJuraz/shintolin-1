* Animals now keep to the forests, and some will **retaliate** if attacked. **Campfires** burn more slowly, and their fuel levels can be seen.
* The XP cost of **new skills** increases as one levels up. **Chopping down trees** now gives Wanderer XP; the AP cost can be reduced by purchasing the **Lumberjack** skill.
