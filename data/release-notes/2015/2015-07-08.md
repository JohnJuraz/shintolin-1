* A **new chat system** has been deployed! There is a new visual design for the message entry area. In addition to that [Shout] is now restricted in its range once again (15 tile radius). To facilitate cross-community discussion, a new [OOC] option has been added that sends a message to every _active_ player (performed an action within the past 24 hours) regardless of where they are on the map. Finally, you can now [Emote]. Enjoy!
* Words etched into buildings (inside & out) are now more prominent.
* Fixed a nasty **memory leak bug** that was causing the game to crash, particularly when a player _shouted_.
* Fixed the healing effectiveness of **thyme** back to pre-relaunch levels.
* Fixed incorrect **AP cost labels** on action buttons.
