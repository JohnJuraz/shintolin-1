* You may now _revive yourself_ in a **Hospital** at a cost of 24 AP. (This only works if you belong to the same settlement as the **Hospital**.)
* While dazed your AP regenerates at _1 AP per hour_. This increases to 2 AP per hour if you are inside a **Hospital**.
* Other than a few exceptions (huts, caves, ruins) most buildings require you to be a **member of their settlement** to get their AP recovery buff.
* Players with the _Medicine_ skill receive an AP recovery buff while inside **Hospitals** as if they were in a **Longhouse**.
* You can now see which players are dazed on their profile screen or on the leaderboards.
* Badges & titles! Players who joined during the first couple of weeks (before July 17, 2015) have received the **Beta Tester** badge, when confers the `of the Vanguard` title. Expect to see more badges/titles in the future.
* Simplified the process of upgrading buildings.
* Reviving a player does not take immediate effect. Using an herbal poultice on a dazed player allows that player to revive themselves for 0 AP and without the need for a hospital.
