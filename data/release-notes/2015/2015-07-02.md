* **Buttercup** has decided to [shut down Shintolin](http://shintolin.forumcircle.com/viewtopic.php?p=21189#21189). In response, **Ecce** (also known as **Deschain**) is now hosting the game at `www.shintolin.com` rather than the old domain of `shintolin.co.uk`. As part of this move (which includes an entirely new codebase built from scratch), all player accounts have been wiped.
* The **Contacts** feature has been removed.
* Added the ability to **change your password** to the profile screen.
