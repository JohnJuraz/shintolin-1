* You may now **vote** for the leader of your settlement from anywhere via the settlement's profile page. Additionally, settlement leaders may **promote/evict** provisional members from the settlement profile from anywhere as well.
* We've done a pass on **farming fields** to ensure all of the functionality works as expected. The mechanics are still quite similar to the classic version of Shintolin, but with yields being more predictable (`+3` growth/night, an addition `+6` growth/night if watered). An _optimal_ year will produce a **net** gain of 79 wheat per field.
* Dropped items now have a chance to be **permanently removed from the game** each night they remain on the ground. This _does not apply_ to items dropped/given to buildings that support the give/take mechanic (example: Stockpiles).
