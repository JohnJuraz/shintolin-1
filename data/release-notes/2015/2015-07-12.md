* All new, all improved **user interface** - now with support for **smartphones**!
* **Hunger** has been revamped! First, hunger now "counts up" instead of down. In other words, high hunger bad, low hunger good. Also hunger no longer decreases your HP or maximum HP when starving. Instead hunger now progressively diminishes your AP regeneration. Time to start farming!
* You can now chat from the **mobile friendly chat page**. Its a great way to stay connected while on-the-go. [Give it a try](https://www.shintolin.com/game/chat)!
