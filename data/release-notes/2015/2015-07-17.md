* **Stockpiles** can once again be built outside of settlements. Rejoice!
* **Huts** now require the **construction skill** to be built (the skill text has always suggested this was required.)
* **Huts** are now considered _tiny_ and can be built in a greater variety of locations.
* The interior of **Cottages** and **Longhouses** now act as if they were _Stockpiles_. You can see their inventory and give/take from it.
* **Huts**, **Cottages**, and **Longhouses** now have a _Maximum Occapancy_ limit (2, 4, 6 respectively). Whenever there are more players than this limit inside the building, that building's AP recovery benefit is disabled for everyone.
* You can now **Kick Out** a dazed player from a building you are in.
* You can now **Drop Items** from the _Self_ action tab.
* The separate **Inventory** screen has been removed for now.
* A number of other minor **bug fixes**.
