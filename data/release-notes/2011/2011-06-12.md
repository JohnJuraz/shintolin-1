Settlements are being put under tighter control:

* Leaders can now **oust** dazed members if they so choose.
* Newcomers must **prove their worth** by **surviving** a full day before they are considered citizens.
* Non-residents and newcomers **cannot perform revives** within a settlement's boundaries, though citizens may revive _them_.
* The starving must now be **fed** before they can be **revived** from their daze
* **Profile** and **settlement images** are resized to a maximum of **300 X 300** pixels, instead of being made exactly 300 pixels wide.
