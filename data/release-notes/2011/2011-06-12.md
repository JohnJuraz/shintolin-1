Settlements are being put under tighter control:

* Leaders can now <b>oust</b> dazed members if they so choose.
* Newcomers must <b>prove their worth</b> by <b>surviving</b> a full day before they are considered citizens.
* Non-residents and newcomers <b>cannot perform revives</b> within a settlement's boundaries, though citizens may revive <i>them</i>.
* The starving must now be <b>fed</b> before they can be <b>revived</b> from their daze
* <b>Profile</b> and <b>settlement images</b> are resized to a maximum of <b>300 X 300</b> pixels, instead of being made exactly 300 pixels wide.
